# Write a short essay about the ethics in Computer Vision

Navigating the ethical landscape of computer vision can feel daunting,
especially when considering how power dynamics and current frameworks often
fall short in real-world applications. However, by pushing for more robust, transparent, and
inclusive guidelines, we can address these challenges head-on.
Imagine a future where computer vision not only enhances our daily lives but does so in a way
that respects our rights and promotes fairness. This optimistic vision is within reach if we 
commit to ethical innovation and continuous improvement.
